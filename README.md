# keter-node

Keter Node uses the keter app as a base to spawn processes in their own working space

basically, you make your regular keter tarball, the keter-node library reads these and runs them as nodes
by renaming the binary and the executables. based on rewrite rules you supply.

Ports are transformed into port ranges
